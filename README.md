# Team Vikings

LearnAR is an AR app developed in unity by the team <b>Vikings</b>, for the HackAgainstCovid Hackathon.

# Features
While theoretical knowledge can be disseminated through online videos and e-schooling, students, particularly those pursuing STEM, miss out on the practical side of their education. A number of STEM courses in High school and university rely on access to laboratories to conduct practical sessions and experiments. Unfortunately, due to the spread of COVID-19 most students are unable to access laboratories and hence miss out on the practical component of their education.

SmartAR looks at a new way of doing labs. The app has inbuilt AR experiments to help students perform experiments from the comfort and safety of their homes. A person will be given three options Practice Mode, Test Mode and Flash Cards.
- ### Practice Mode:  
    In this mode this mode the person can select an experiment which he can practice and test different combinations in the experiment.
- ### Test Mode:
    In this mode a student can type in the test code and give a lab test which will be immidiately graded and the marks will be stored on the blockchain.
- ### Flash Cards:
    Topic based models and question directly echoAR se fetch ho rha hai and we can keep adding more without any change to the code.These are to help students memorize hard concepts and make it possible for them to use one of the most common techniques to memorize premade flashcard.
